# Contributing to Gimel Studio

**Welcome. We're excited to have you!**

Gimel Studio is an open source project and we love to receive contributions! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting UI translations, bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Gimel Studio itself.

We primarily communicate via GitHub and the [Community Chat](https://gimelstudio.zulipchat.com).

Like many open-source projects, we require you to sign a CLA (Contributor License Agreement) when you contribute for the first time.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

Make sure to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined  your bug is related to, create an issue in the repository and provide as much helpful information as you can to help us understand the problem.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Gimel Studio? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Good First issues](https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which shouldn't require an in-depth knowledge of the existing code. Some of these can be challenging even though they don't require a lot of code though!
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

If you have any questions about contributing, feel free to ask on the official [community chat](https://gimelstudio.zulipchat.com) or in a Github issue.
