### Contributing

Much of the application is in very active development at the moment, and there is plenty to do and figure out. If you would like to help out, feel free to join our [community chat](https://gimelstudio.zulipchat.com/join/sif32f3gjpnikveonzgc7zhw/). Additionally take a look at the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio/issues) for tasks to be done if you would like to contribute code. Issues labeled ‚ÄúGood first issue‚Äù will be the best for new contributors. 

If you're interested in helping with development, at the moment there are open issues for implementing some necessary widgets. Implementing a widget is a great way to get involved, learn Flutter/Dart, and get familar with the Gimel Studio codebase.

We are willing to mentor any contributors as needed.

**Pull requests are welcome. :)**

Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for some details on contributing.


### Running the code

- Install Flutter and Dart for your system following the instructions at [docs.flutter.dev](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install),
- Run ``flutter pub get`` to fetch the dependencies.
- Run ``flutter run`` to build and launch the application.

So far, the code has been tested on Windows 10, Zorin OS (Linux), and the web.

Gimel Studio aims to run fully cross-platform on desktop (Linux, Windows, and macOS) with "best-effort" support for running in the browser as a web application.


### Looking for the v0.6.x series?

You can find the previous v0.6.x series written in Python and GLSL [here](https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio/tree/v0.6.x-series).
